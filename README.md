Hi!

The contents in this repo are just some small coding projects I watched from youtube to better my knowledge and understanding in programming.
I would advise you that when you're watching a coding video on youtube or any other site, you should also code side by side.
Pause the video, take your time to understand the logic behind the code and also try to experiment by using applying a different approach to your program and not just follow the steps of the person coding.
The worst that could happen is coming across an error which will make you question even more actually
I apologise for sounding like a teacher.
I'm just like you someone that likes to code and wants to make it work and keep on learning.

Happy Coding!
